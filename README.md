# Tourism in Brazil App

The **Tourism in Brazil App** is a simple graphical application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to manage and explore tourism destinations in Brazil. This app provides the following features:

- **Add a New Destination:** Users can enter information about a new tourism destination, including its macro region, state (UF), touristic region, municipality, and cluster.

- **See All Destinations:** Users can view a list of all recorded destinations, including their details.

- **Export to Excel:** The app allows users to export the list of destinations to an Excel file for easy data management and sharing.

This project uses SQLite as the database backend to store and retrieve destination information. The graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using Tkinter, a popular Python library for creating desktop applications.

## Data Source
